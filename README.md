# HollowVR ðŸ“±ðŸ¥½
An VR device made with your phone!

# Why is this a thing? 
I made this because I (used) to not have a VR Device. Many others have this problem, so I decided to make this for people (like me) who don't (or didn't) have a VR headset, but have the phone mount or cardboard to make a Google Cardboard.
